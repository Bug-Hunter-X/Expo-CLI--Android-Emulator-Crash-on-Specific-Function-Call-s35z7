While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the Expo CLI and its interaction with the Android emulator.  After running `expo start`, the app launched on the emulator, but whenever a specific function was called, the emulator would become unresponsive and eventually crash. This occurred consistently only on the emulator; the app worked fine on a physical device. The error logs didn't provide specific clues, showing only generic messages about the app process stopping unexpectedly.
